#CacheLite
##What Is CacheLite
CacheLite is a class that encapsulates the Pear::Cache_Lite class for caching information. The extension is designed to work as a standalone extension as well as an extension that adapters to the normal PVCache Class.
##Warning
The current version of cache lite has not been tested, this is merely pseudo code.
